Gorlok
    Main baddie

        Hates you at first, then loves you
    - Jorlok - wife

Icram the Enchanter (also sneakily The Narrator)
    Main baddie, but for real
    Actual final boss to fight, with Snorlok by your side

*Items*

    The 'enchanted' (cursed) plate armor that Gorlok wears
    It controls his mind / affect
    Cursed by Icram, but it's got good stats

Rusty Spoon #might change
    Player's ult? Not an actual spoon, maybe just a nickname for some kind of broadsword
